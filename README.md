## Cotton plant and leaf disease prediction

Used 2 models for predicting whether, if the cotton plant has a disease or not, using the inceptionv3 model and the ResNet50 model.

We see that the inceptionv3 is better in terms of validation accuracy eventhough it has 2 million less params then the ResNet50 application of transfer learning.

Accuracy  of InceptionV3  - 96%
