🚀 Project Overview
This project detects whether a cotton plant leaf is healthy or diseased using two state-of-the-art CNN architectures:

  ✅ InceptionV3 — achieves 96% validation accuracy

  ✅ ResNet50 — slightly lower accuracy despite more parameters


📂 Dataset
Images of healthy and diseased cotton leaves.

Preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets


⚙️ Models Used
Model	Parameters	Validation Accuracy
InceptionV3	~21 million	✅ 96%
ResNet50	~23 million	~94%

Conclusion: InceptionV3 performs better with fewer parameters.
